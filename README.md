# opencode2api

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A Go gateway for **OpenCode Zen and Zen Go**. It exposes Chat Completions, Responses, and Anthropic Messages endpoints, translates between their native protocols, and manages upstream keys and proxies.

The executable includes the WebUI. Running the service requires no Node.js runtime or database.

## Capabilities

- JSON and SSE responses across all three inference protocols.
- Text, images, reasoning, function tools, tool calls, and tool results; file content where the target protocol can represent it.
- Separate Zen and Go key pools, configurable tier preference, retries, and session affinity.
- Automatic true keyless Zen, complete upstream model discovery and optional anonymous-first 429 fallback.
- Direct, HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5, and SOCKS5H connections, including a proxy file.
- Dynamic model discovery, native protocol metadata, and disk caches.
- A separate management port with configuration editing, a Playground, diagnostics, token statistics, and live logs.
- Configuration hot reload with validation before switching new requests to a replacement gateway.
- Go subscription quota dashboard with remaining percentages, reset times, and available models.
- Local API key creation, naming, enabling, disabling, and deletion with immediate updates.
- Sticky `sota` / `sweet` model groups with ordering, failure fallback, streaming protection, and persisted state.

See the [management console guide (Chinese)](docs/management.zh-CN.md) for the new pages and configuration.

## Quick start

Download a binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Youzini-afk/opencode2api/releases), or build with **Go 1.24 or newer**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Youzini-afk/opencode2api.git
cd opencode2api
cp config.example.json config.json
go build -o opencode2api ./cmd/opencode2api
```

Before starting, edit `config.json`:

1. Replace `server_keys` with your own local API key.
2. Supply Zen/Go keys if needed; both arrays may be empty without enabling any new flag.
3. Replace `webui.password`. The example enables the WebUI with username `admin`.

```bash
./opencode2api -config config.json
```

On Windows, use `Copy-Item config.example.json config.json`, build with `go build -o opencode2api.exe ./cmd/opencode2api`, then run `.\opencode2api.exe -config config.json`.

The example listens on `127.0.0.1:8080` for the API and `0.0.0.0:8081` for the WebUI. Open `http://localhost:8081` locally. Restrict management access and use an HTTPS reverse proxy when accessing it over a network.

Command-line options:

| Option        | Default       | Purpose                            |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `-config`     | `config.json` | Configuration file path.           |
| `-listen`     | Unset         | Override the API listen address.   |
| `-web-listen` | Unset         | Override the WebUI listen address. |

The configuration directory must be writable for password migration, configuration saves, and model caches.

## Docker

Compose builds this fork from local source. API and WebUI share one port by default.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set your local API keys and WebUI password; upstream keys are optional.
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f
```

`PORT` sets the container listener (default 8080); `OPENCODE2API_PORT` sets the host port. `LISTEN_ADDRESS` and `WEBUI_LISTEN_ADDRESS` can explicitly override the listeners. The state volume is mounted at `/var/lib/opencode2api`; Compose uses a read-only root filesystem and writable state volume.

Only a missing config is initialized from `OPENCODE2API_*` variables. Existing config always wins, including when a referenced proxy file is missing. Passwords are hashed before the first bootstrap write. Missing config and missing bootstrap variables fail startup without public example credentials.

Zeabur Git deployments automatically use its injected `PORT` for both API and WebUI. Mount persistent storage at `/var/lib/opencode2api` to retain WebUI changes. See [fork deployment and compatibility details](docs/fork.zh-CN.md).

Release tags publish this fork's multi-platform binaries and `ghcr.io/youzini-afk/opencode2api` images. Ordinary main pushes do not create releases.

## API usage

`server_keys` authenticate clients to this gateway. They are separate from `zen_keys` and `go_keys` and are never used as upstream credentials.

Send `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_LOCAL_API_KEY` or `x-api-key: YOUR_LOCAL_API_KEY`. Health checks require no authentication.

| Method | Path                   | Description                                               |
| ------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/v1/models`           | Models that can be routed with the current configuration. |
| POST   | `/v1/chat/completions` | Chat Completions.                                         |
| POST   | `/v1/responses`        | Responses.                                                |
| POST   | `/v1/messages`         | Anthropic Messages.                                       |
| POST   | `/v1/systemone`        | System One structured decisions.                          |
| GET    | `/healthz`             | Readiness and resource summary.                           |

Discover an available model first:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_LOCAL_API_KEY"
```

Replace `MODEL_ID` below with an ID from that response.

**Chat Completions**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_LOCAL_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"MODEL_ID","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

**Responses**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_LOCAL_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"MODEL_ID","input":"Hello"}'
```

**Anthropic Messages**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_LOCAL_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"MODEL_ID","max_tokens":512,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

For streaming, add `"stream": true` to the body and use `curl -N`. Responses include an `x-request-id` for correlation. API request bodies are limited to 32 MiB.

**System One**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/systemone \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_LOCAL_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"MODEL_ID","state":"1 + 1 = 2","questions":{"arithmetic":{"type":"noul","instructions":"Is 1 + 1 equal to 2?"}}}'
```

System One pairs a free-form state with typed questions and returns typed answers, so the payload shares no shape with the chat/responses bridge and is relayed verbatim, never translated. Only models whose native protocol is System One are served here; a decision payload submitted on a message endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`) is likewise relayed verbatim instead of converted. Streaming upstream replies are relayed as-is without reset recovery.

### Compatibility boundaries

Requests using the upstream's native protocol retain provider-specific fields. Requests crossing protocols pass through a common representation; not every option has an equivalent. For example, Chat JSON output constraints and `seed` are not forwarded to Anthropic Messages. Unsupported content or tool types may be rejected.

The gateway exposes the routes listed above. It does not implement embeddings, file uploads, image generation, or Responses retrieval and cancellation. It does not store conversation history; clients must supply the history or use features supported by the actual upstream.

## Routing and models

### Model discovery

The gateway refreshes Zen/Go `/v1/models` and OpenCode's [capability catalog](https://models.opencode.ai/api.json) on the configured interval. Native protocols and model limits are tracked separately for each tier. OpenCode's Zen/Go documentation is a fallback for protocol discovery.

`models.protocols` overrides discovery:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "refresh_seconds": 300,
    "protocols": {
      "custom-model": "chat"
    }
  }
}
```

Protocol values are `chat`, `responses`, `anthropic`, and `systemone`. Discovered models remain visible even if capability metadata is missing or unknown; explicit overrides take precedence.

Cost, deprecation, and model limits come from the official [OpenCode metadata endpoint](https://models.opencode.ai/api.json), refreshed every 24 hours. OpenCode's capability catalog remains authoritative for context and token limits; metadata `limit.context`, `limit.input`, and `limit.output` fill fields missing from that catalog. These limits are exposed by `/v1/models` as `context_window`/`context_length`, `max_input`, and `max_output` for discovery clients such as CLIProxyAPI and Pi. Metadata requests use a 30-second timeout per HTTP client. Refresh failures retain existing data.

Each `/v1/models` entry also carries `cost` (USD per million tokens: `input`, `output`, `cache_read`, `cache_write`, plus OpenClaw's `cacheRead`/`cacheWrite`) when the metadata states a price. Reasoning models list their levels in `reasoning_efforts` and in OpenClaw's `compat.supportedReasoningEfforts`: `minimal` through `max`, capped at the probed ceiling when the model's effort is `auto`. A forced or probed level is reported as `default_reasoning_effort`. Cache prices appear after the next metadata refresh.

### Anonymous access and fallback

No Zen key automatically enables anonymous access without a personal API key. The official anonymous backend uses the public `public` marker; custom relays receive no authentication header by default. With configured keys, `anonymous: true` explicitly prefers anonymous access. By default models are never hidden or pre-rejected by price, free-name suffix, provider, Gemini name or probe status; the upstream decides access. `models.free_only: true` is an explicit opt-in to restrict both discovery and routing to models classified as free.

Anonymous requests use the configured retry budget for transport failures, 5xx and 429. Anonymous 401/403 and other non-429 4xx return immediately. Only an anonymous 429 permits fallback to one authenticated tier selected by `prefer`. Ordinary keyed requests stay in their preferred tier and rotate keys within that tier.

Requests are encoded separately for each actual target protocol. Optional `performance.first_event_timeout_seconds` allows retry before the first complete SSE data event. Once output is committed downstream it is never replayed. Recognized stale Responses reasoning references can trigger one repair pass with the same request identity; selected-key diagnostics never use that replay.

Official OpenCode endpoints automatically use the current CLI request shape: upstream streaming and official core tool schemas, replacing recognized same-name tool schemas when required by the gate. Non-streaming clients still receive a collapsed JSON response. Custom relays remain transparent unless `upstream.agent_shaping` is explicitly enabled. `upstream.anonymous` selects the anonymous inference URL; when omitted, official Zen upgrades to `https://opencode.ai/inference`, while a custom Zen URL is reused. A missing directory on the inference backend falls back to the configured Zen directory.

### Model availability diagnostics

`models.probe_availability` is off by default. Enabling it sends periodic short inference probes, which can consume upstream allowance. Results are diagnostic only and never hide models or block production inference. Probe state and manual reset remain available through the authenticated WebUI and availability APIs.

Manual control pauses a model's probes; returning to automatic mode schedules a new probe. `reasoning.effort: "auto"` uses recent validated observations only, and does not itself turn probing on. Temporary errors never establish that a model has been retired. `POST /api/models/manual` accepts `{"model":"MODEL_ID","manual":true|false}` with management authentication and CSRF protection.

### Sessions and proxies

Keys are initially spread across proxies. Real traffic can trigger proxy checks, key rebinding, and cooldowns. Unhealthy proxies are rechecked every 15 minutes against Cloudflare trace.

A stable session hash selects the preferred key or anonymous proxy. Send an explicit `x-session-id` to separate independent conversations. The gateway also accepts `x-opencode-session`, `x-session-affinity`, `conversation-id`, `conversation_id`, and `metadata.session_id`.

Without an explicit ID, the first user message is used as a seed. Conversations beginning with the same content can therefore share affinity. Changing pool membership can change the selected node.

Cooldowns grow exponentially up to eight times `performance.failure_cooldown_seconds`, and a longer `Retry-After` is honored. If every authenticated key is cooling down, routing may try the key whose cooldown ends first. When every anonymous node is cooling, retries may use the earliest-expiring one within the configured budget, including rotating proxy URLs.

## Configuration reference

See [config.example.json](config.example.json) for a complete starting configuration. JSON supports `//` and `/* ... */` comments; unknown fields and invalid values are rejected.

### Keys, listeners, and routing

| Field                       | Default / requirement                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `listen`                    | `127.0.0.1:8080`.                                                              |
| `server_keys`               | At least one local key is required.                                            |
| `zen_keys`, `go_keys`       | Both arrays may be empty; a missing Zen key automatically enables keyless Zen. |
| `anonymous`                 | `false`.                                                                       |
| `prefer`                    | `go`; accepts `go` or `zen`.                                                   |
| `upstream.zen`              | `https://opencode.ai/zen`.                                                     |
| `upstream.go`               | `https://opencode.ai/zen/go`.                                                  |
| `upstream.anonymous`        | Optional; official Zen uses `https://opencode.ai/inference`, custom Zen retains its own URL. |
| `proxies`                   | Falls back to `["direct"]` when both proxy sources are empty.                  |
| `proxyfile`                 | Optional; relative paths resolve beside the configuration file.                |
| `models.refresh_seconds`    | `300`; minimum 1.                                                              |
| `models.protocols`          | `{}`; per-model native protocol overrides.                                     |
| `models.free_only`          | `false`; opt-in free-model filtering for discovery and inference. |
| `models.probe_availability` | `false`; optional diagnostic inference probes. |
| `reasoning.effort`          | Empty (off); `auto`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, or `none`. |
| `reasoning.effort_by_model` | `{}`; per-model overrides of `reasoning.effort`.                               |

### Session-stable CLI fingerprints

`fingerprint.versions` is a configurable pool of OpenCode CLI versions. A deterministic rendezvous hash selects a version per conversation. User-Agent is `opencode/latest/<version>/cli`; the descending-encoded session and SHA-1-shaped project stay stable. Both `x-opencode-session` and `x-opencode-session-id` carry that session. Each client request still has a fresh local trace ID reused across retries and returned as `x-request-id`; the obsolete `x-opencode-request` header is not sent upstream. Parent-session affinity and existing version pools persist through configuration edits and reloads.

### Forced thinking level

This fork expresses an effort without an explicit manual budget as adaptive thinking. Valid caller-specified manual budgets are preserved; an invalid budget exceeding max_tokens uses adaptive mode. Applying a default effort never increases the caller's max_tokens.

`reasoning.effort` sets the thinking level used upstream when a request does not
state one of its own, and `reasoning.effort_by_model` overrides it for the model
IDs it names. It applies to all three protocols, in either direction of
conversion, and matters most for cross-protocol traffic: an Anthropic
`thinking.budget_tokens` can only be approximated by the Chat and Responses
surfaces, so a forced level reaches a rung that the budget alone cannot express.

```json
{
  "reasoning": {
    "effort": "high",
    "effort_by_model": { "claude-opus-5": "max" }
  }
}
```

A level a client states explicitly always wins, so this only replaces a level
nobody asked for: an absent one, or one derived from `thinking.budget_tokens`.
Use `"none"` to remove reasoning from requests that do not ask for it.

Levels are reported faithfully in both directions. An explicit
`output_config.effort` survives conversion instead of being shadowed by a
`thinking` block, `budget_tokens` keeps its rung (`8192` is `high`, `32000` is
`xhigh`, so the two stay distinguishable), and the Responses target carries the
level as `reasoning.effort` rather than dropping it.

The WebUI Configuration Center exposes the same default and per-model fields.
The management API returns them as `reasoning` from `GET /api/config` and accepts
the object in `PUT /api/config`; clients that omit the field keep the existing
value, while sending an empty object clears it.

Proxy entries accept `direct`, `http://`, `https://`, `socks5://`, and `socks5h://`, including URL credentials. The inline list is merged with `proxyfile` and deduplicated in order.

A proxy file contains one entry per line and supports blank lines and comments:

```text
# Primary proxy
http://user:password@127.0.0.1:7890
socks5://127.0.0.1:1080  # Backup proxy
direct
```

Comment markers are `#`, `;`, and `//` at the start of a line or after whitespace.

### Timeouts and connection pools

| Field                                   | Default | Meaning                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `retry.max_attempts`                    | `3`     | Attempts per channel, including the first; only anonymous 429 permits one preferred key fallback. |
| `retry.timeout_seconds`                 | `300`   | Total inference timeout, including stream consumption.                                            |
| `performance.attempt_timeout_seconds`   | `0`     | Per-attempt dial, write, headers and optional first-event deadline; 0 uses the request timeout. |
| `performance.connect_timeout_seconds`   | `5`     | Connection establishment timeout.                                                                 |
| `performance.failure_cooldown_seconds`  | `15`    | Base failure cooldown.                                                                            |
| `performance.max_idle_conns`            | `2048`  | Idle connection limit per proxy transport.                                                        |
| `performance.max_idle_conns_per_host`   | `256`   | Idle connection limit per host and transport.                                                     |
| `performance.max_conns_per_host`        | `0`     | Connection limit per host; 0 is unlimited.                                                        |
| `performance.idle_conn_timeout_seconds` | `120`   | Idle connection lifetime.                                                                         |

The per-attempt deadline is capped by the request timeout and disarmed once the response is released, so it cannot cut an established stream. It also applies to System One (without an SSE first-event wait). Set it below the total timeout to leave time for fallback. Expired request contexts stop further attempts without penalizing unused keys or proxies.

### Logging and management

| Field                         | Default / requirement                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `logging.level`               | `info`; accepts `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.             |
| `logging.ring_size`           | `2000`; range 100–50,000.                                     |
| `logging.dump_request_bodies` | `false`. Requires `debug` logging to emit outbound bodies.    |
| `webui.enabled`               | `false` when omitted; the example sets it to `true`.          |
| `webui.listen`                | `0.0.0.0:8081`.                                               |
| `webui.username`              | Required when the WebUI is enabled; the example uses `admin`. |
| `webui.password`              | Bootstrap password with a minimum length of 10.               |
| `webui.password_hash`         | Generated Argon2id hash; replaces the plaintext password.     |
| `webui.session_ttl_minutes`   | `720`; range 5–10,080.                                        |

On startup, a bootstrap password is hashed and removed from the configuration. The backup containing that bootstrap plaintext is deleted. Keep configuration files and backups private: upstream keys and proxy credentials remain necessary configuration secrets.

Body dumps are opt-in and capped at 64 KiB per prepared body. Configured secrets are redacted, but conversation content may still be sensitive.

## WebUI and diagnostics

The management listener serves the UI and `/api/*` routes. Authentication uses one administrator account, server-side sessions, HttpOnly/SameSite cookies, CSRF checks for writes, and login throttling.

| Management route                                 | Purpose                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /api/auth/login`                           | Log in and obtain a session cookie and CSRF token.                    |
| `GET /api/auth/session`, `POST /api/auth/logout` | Inspect or end the session.                                           |
| `GET /api/config`, `PUT /api/config`             | Read masked configuration or apply changes.                           |
| `POST /api/config/reload`                        | Reload the file from disk.                                            |
| `POST /api/config/reveal`                        | Reveal configured secrets after password verification.                |
| `PUT /api/account`                               | Update credentials after password verification; invalidates sessions. |
| `GET /api/monitor`                               | Request, token, upstream, and resource statistics.                    |
| `GET /api/debug/models`                          | Model routes, key fingerprints, and metadata diagnostics.             |
| `POST /api/debug/inference`                      | Run a Playground request.                                             |
| `GET /api/logs`, `GET /api/logs/stream`          | Recent logs or a live SSE subscription.                               |

Playground requests require a session and `X-CSRF-Token`:

```json
{
  "protocol": "chat",
  "key": { "mode": "auto" },
  "request": {
    "model": "MODEL_ID",
    "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello" }]
  }
}
```

The server forces `stream: false`. Use `{"mode":"selected","tier":"zen","id":"KEY_FINGERPRINT"}` to test a specific key from `/api/debug/models`. A selected request makes at most one upstream attempt, without anonymous access, key rotation, tier fallback, or reasoning replay.

**Both automatic and selected diagnostics preserve production key cooldowns, failure counts, proxy health, and bindings.** They still make real upstream requests, can consume provider quota, and appear in monitoring.

After execution, the management endpoint returns HTTP 200 with the actual result in `ok`, `http_status`, `request_id`, `route`, and `response`. Selected-key results also include `selected_key` and `key_test`: `usable`, `rejected`, `rate_limited`, `transport_error`, `upstream_error`, `request_error`, or `unavailable`. Invalid management input, authentication, CSRF, and throttling retain their own HTTP error statuses.

### Saving and reloading

The server validates a candidate configuration and builds its replacement gateway before saving and switching. Failed validation or persistence leaves the active gateway in place. Requests already running continue on their original gateway.

Keys, proxies, upstream URLs, retry settings, model settings, logging, and routing preferences apply to new requests immediately. Changes to `listen`, `webui.listen`, or `webui.enabled` require a process restart. Saved JSON is normalized; comments are not retained.

## Monitoring and persistence

Request outcomes describe the completed inference. A failed SSE response or truncated stream counts as an error even when HTTP 200 was already sent; its outcome is `stream_error`. Client cancellations are recorded as `client_canceled`. The WebUI displays those outcomes alongside the HTTP status.

Upstream **attempt** records measure the HTTP exchange through receipt of response headers. Their success and latency are separate from completion of the full JSON body or stream.

Token statistics use reported usage only. Input tokens include cache reads and writes; cached tokens separately count cache reads. Missing usage is not estimated, and coverage shows how many routed inference requests reported usage. `usage.server_keys` splits requests and tokens by the local server key the caller authenticated with (its fingerprint, as shown in `/api/api-keys`); Playground traffic is counted under `playground`.

Cache filenames are based on the actual configuration path. Lifetime counters mean the current process lifetime. Instances do not share sessions or monitoring state.

### Health checks

`/healthz` does not increment monitoring counters or trigger network requests. It reports resource counts without keys or proxy addresses.

- HTTP 503: initial catalog pending, no models routable with the current configuration, or no healthy proxies.
- HTTP 200: ready, including when a usable catalog cache is stale. In that case the model status is `stale` and overall status is `degraded`.

The staleness threshold is twice `models.refresh_seconds`, with a minimum of 60 seconds. Readiness is a discovery and resource check; it does not verify that an upstream key will accept the next inference.

## Development

Go source is organized into packages by responsibility. The command wires the service together; implementation packages live under `internal/`.

```text

```

Suggested reading order:

1. [Command entry](cmd/opencode2api/main.go) → [runtime management](internal/gateway/runtime.go) → [HTTP handlers](internal/gateway/gateway.go).
2. [Upstream attempts](internal/gateway/upstream.go) and [model routing](internal/models/catalog.go) explain how a request reaches a provider.
3. [Request conversion](internal/protocol/request.go), [response conversion](internal/protocol/response.go), and [stream transport](internal/protocol/stream.go) cover protocol behavior.
4. [Management routes](internal/admin/server.go) and [WebUI logic](webui/app.js) cover configuration and diagnostics.

Run Go formatting, analysis, and the command build:

```bash
gofmt -w cmd internal webui
go vet ./...
go build -o opencode2api ./cmd/opencode2api
```

For local development, start the service with `go run ./cmd/opencode2api -config config.json`. Release builds still inject the version with `-ldflags "-X main.version=vX.Y.Z"`.

Node.js is only needed for the WebUI JavaScript syntax check:

```bash
node --check webui/app.js
```

`.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, and Go formatting standardize the source. CI runs `go vet` and builds with Go 1.24 and stable Go on Linux/Windows, plus Go formatting, WebUI syntax, and entrypoint shell syntax checks. Release archives include both READMEs.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                              | Check                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API returns 401                      | Use a configured local `server_keys` value.                                               |
| Health remains `starting`            | Inspect catalog refresh logs and outbound connectivity; add protocol overrides if needed. |
| No models are exposed                | Check configured tiers, anonymous eligibility, and native protocol support.               |
| Requests return 502/504              | Inspect upstream attempts, credentials, proxies, and total/per-attempt timeouts.          |
| HTTP 200 but generation failed       | Inspect the SSE error event and request outcome, not only HTTP status.                    |
| Host edits have no effect in Docker  | The active file is in the state volume; import it again or use the WebUI.                 |
| Container ports are unreachable      | Check listener addresses, published ports, and the active volume configuration.           |
| Monitoring disappeared after restart | Monitoring is stored only in memory; collect stdout logs externally.                      |

### Adaptive reasoning effort

Set `reasoning.effort` (or a per-model override) to `auto` to use the highest effort successfully validated by the free-model probe. Existing concrete levels retain their meaning and client-specified effort takes precedence. No model-name allowlist is maintained.

After a baseline succeeds, reasoning-capable models are probed in `max`, `xhigh`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `minimal` order. Only an explicit reasoning-parameter rejection advances to a lower level. Transient failures stop the search and cannot be interpreted as a lower capability ceiling. If every level is rejected, no reasoning override is injected.

Observations are persisted by upstream URL, model and native protocol, displayed in the availability page, and used for at most two hours. Active probes cover only free Zen/anonymous models; Go/paid models, unknown capabilities and unverified levels receive no automatic override. Setting `auto` does not expand the probe scope or guarantee that upstreams enforce every accepted field. Probing may require several small requests per model and uses upstream allowance.
